# Study-Planner

Hey there! My name is Abdelrahman Wael, and this is the presentation of my new software “Study Planner! 

We’ve all been there at a point where we have mountains of books on the desk, dozens of unread emails and 
a few missed calls from an angry boss. The reason behind that is that most of students don’t or can’t manage time efficiently, resulting in that situation that I’ve mentioned, where the ship has already sunk.

I had to validate the problem and determine its significance. So, I decided to construct random street interviews with students, whom are the victims of this problem. I even spread-out surveys and the results confirmed my point of view. More than 90% of the students believe the Study Planner would solve the problem of time management. They also believe it would be too helpful and might reduce the negative consequences of time management by up to 87%. So, what is study planner?!

The idea is to create a handy tool for students in order to generate automated “Study Plans” and “Task Managers”. This way time management will be a piece of a cake. Instead of procrastinating all day long and trying to slapdash all tasks a few minutes before the deadline.

The concept is to create a data entry form which receives input such as number of days, number of new lectures, number of old lectures, number of days off, hours available per day, etc. and to link it with a spreadsheet, then create a schedule and view it to the user.

I created the form using Visual Basic for Application and embedded it in a macro-enabled excel sheet with prewritten formulas to process the data according to certain criteria, and split it on the days inputted previously. A schedule consisting of all the tasks is then generated and viewed to the user and could be printed or edited of course for optimal customization. 

The aim of the software is to help students with time management and to boost their productivity. Which is proven to be achieved using study plans by multiple researches. Students can now have customized Study Plans that are interactive, dynamic and reliable.
